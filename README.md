As I've progressed in my software developer career, I've learned, often the hard way, that **doing things in certain ways was more productive, increased quality, and facilitated cooperation with my teammates**.

At some point I've started thinking about programming as a *craft*. Extremely hard to master, evolving quickly, and very demanding. Let me show you the definition of a *craftsman* from the online Cambridge English Dictionary:

> Craftsman – a person who is skilled, especially someone who makes things by hand

I really like the sound of that. Aren't software developers the craftsmen of the 21<sup>st</sup> century?

This document is a conclusion of my findings related to working as a software developer. I believe that the ideas presented in this document will allow a developer to progress towards becoming a master craftsman in the land of software development. All topics presented here are technology-agnostic, meaning that it doesn't matter which programming language or framework is your domain.

I've divided the document into *Elements*, grouped by topics they relate to. I really liked the idea of *"Items"* in Joshua Bloch's astounding *Effective Java* book. The author clearly presented a way-to-go for various Java programming paradigms and problems in his *Items*. I came up with the notion of *Elements*, which are, in my opinion, a foundation for becoming a master craftsman. I myself am nowhere near to becoming one, yet, but I feel I'm on the right course.

All ideas presented here are just my thoughts. I'm basing them on experience gained on many projects I have been working on over the years – maybe you will agree with me on some of them, and disagree on other. I'd like to know what you think about them, and it would be great if you would share your thoughts – I'll happily receive any e-mails: <przemyslaw.kruglej@gmail.com>.
